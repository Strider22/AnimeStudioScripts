Overview
========
This repository is a collection of scripts for [Anime Studio Pro](http://my.smithmicro.com/anime-studio-pro.html). It's primary purpose is to help 
me with animation I'm trying to do in Anime Studio. I do this as a hobby. As a result I can't make promises that any particular piece of code is 
helpful to others, that it works on your system or that it has even been completed. In general I expect the code to be clean and useful, but I cannot 
promise any fixes. 

Having said all that, I do hope the repository can be helpful to you. The [Anime Studio Community](http://www.lostmarble.com/forum/) is really great
and I've been helped a lot by examples that others have shared, so feel free to use the code here for your own purposes.
