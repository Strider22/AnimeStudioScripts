Overview
========
This repository is a collection of scripts for [Anime Studio Pro](http://my.smithmicro.com/anime-studio-pro.html). It's primary purpose is to help 
me with animation I'm trying to do in Anime Studio. I do this as a hobby. As a result I can't make promises that any particular piece of code is 
helpful to others, that it works on your system or that it has even been completed. In general I expect the code to be clean and useful, but I cannot 
promise any fixes. 

Having said all that, I do hope the repository can be helpful to you. The [Anime Studio Community](http://www.lostmarble.com/forum/) is really great
and I've been helped a lot by examples that others have shared, so feel free to use the code here for your own purposes.

Organization
============
The files are organized in the standard Anime Studio script file structure. I do have a utility directory that holds scripts that may be used by the main scripts. 

Getting the Scripts
===================
You can just click on the Download ZIP link (to the right) to get the latest set of scripts. I also will create 
[releases(https://github.com/Strider22/AnimeStudioScripts/releases) from time to time to 
demark milestones of code development. The first release is available.
